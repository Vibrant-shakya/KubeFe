# KubeFe

KubeFe

The KubFe App is a tool that analyzes the resource consumption of your Kubernetes pods and provides optimized resource configuration suggestions for your manifests. This app uses multiple algorithms to identify patterns in your pod's resource usage and then provides recommendations for optimizing your pod's resource allocation.

Features
The Kubernetes Resource Optimization App has the following features:

Resource analysis: The app analyzes the resource consumption of your Kubernetes pods and identifies any patterns in their usage.

Resource suggestions: Based on the analysis, the app provides recommendations for optimizing your pod's resource allocation, including CPU and memory limits and requests.

Customizable thresholds: You can set customizable thresholds for the app to use when analyzing your pod's resource consumption. For example, you can set a threshold for CPU usage at 80%, and the app will only provide recommendations for pods that exceed this threshold.

Easy integration: The app can be easily integrated into your Kubernetes environment using Kubernetes manifests.

How it works
The KubeFe App works by analyzing the resource consumption of your Kubernetes pods. The app uses multiple algorithms to identify patterns in your pod's resource usage, such as when CPU or memory usage spikes, and then provides recommendations for optimizing your pod's resource allocation.

To use the app, you simply need to deploy it to your Kubernetes environment using Kubernetes manifests. Once deployed, the app will automatically begin analyzing your pod's resource consumption and providing recommendations for optimizing your pod's resource allocation.
